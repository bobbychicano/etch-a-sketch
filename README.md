## Etch-A-Sketch Web Application

---

For this project, I created a desktop web application that allows the user to draw simple patterns on a grid sketchpad by hovering their mouse over grid cells, causing the color of the grid cell to change.

The user can reset the grid at any time by clicking a button at the top of the page, which also prompts the user for a number that is used to resize the grid by that number of rows and columns.

This project tested my abilities in DOM Manipulation and helped me grow my understanding of selecting and altering HTML elements with JavaScript.  

Notably, it helped me learn more about an HTMLCollection versus a NodeList when attempting to select many elements at one time.
